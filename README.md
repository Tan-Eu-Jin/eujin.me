# **_EUJIN[]().ME_**

## **_Purpose_**

This website is a side project worked on in my free time to provide myself the following:

- hands-on experience dealing with the ins and out of multiple and different web development framework.
- creating a simple webserver hosting experience with cloud services.
- this gives me a neat little personal website.

## **_Tech_**

[**Digital Ocean**](https://www.digitalocean.com/) _Ubuntu 18.04.3 (LTS) x64_ - Virtual machine hosting and whatnots.

[**Nginx**](https://www.nginx.com/) _1.14.0 (Ubuntu)_ - Web server configurations and all thing configs.

[**Node**](https://nodejs.org/en/) _v16.13.0_ - Makes all the following Javascript library tick properly.

[**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/) _v6.14.4_ - Lets you get node packages easily. You will need npm to get the other packages.
`Note: NVM (Node Version Manager) can be used to ease the installation of NPM (Node Package Manage)`

[**NuxtJS**](https://nuxtjs.ir/) _v2.2.0_ - The Javascript framework for web development.

[**VueJS**](https://vuejs.org/) _v2.6.14_- Frontend library shipped with NuxtJS.

[**Vuetify**](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) _v2.6.2_ - Material design library add-on for NuxtJS.

[**Google Analytics via Google Tags**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/google-tag-manager) _v2.3.2_ - The project uses the nuxt/google-tag-manage module as an extention to handle all things analytics.

[**Backend**]() - I'll think of something soon, maybe... Need ideas. Open for suggestions.

## **_Set Up_**

This section assumes that this project is set up in a local environment. Since this is a full **NodeJs** project, only npm is needed to set up and compile the project. Due to the configuration inside this project, this project will always serve on the ip of the computer.

Run the following set of commands in the terminal, inside the project directory.
`Note: This is not a comprehensive and production-ready set up. Lets you run this project on your local machine.`

```
$ cd ~/eujin.me/
$ npm install
$ npm build
$ npm start
```

###### **_Take Aways_**

This has been a really fun side project for me to work on. I will be willing to fix up any issues that persist or develop any features that are requested but they will be developed at my own pace. Pull reqeusts are welcomed.

It is my hope that anybody and everybody can clone this project and set up a page for themselves, change the title, names and details _`(cause it'll be weird if you don't)`_ and then have a little fun personal website.
